    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
        Hematology is the study of blood, the blood forming organs, and the blood diseases. Hematology includes the study of etiology, diagnosis treatment, prognosis and prevention of blood diseases that affect the production of blood and the components; such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood protein and mechanism of coagulation.
The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by the medical technologist. Some of the tests carried out are; Packed Cell Volume (P.C.V.) estimation, Blood Grouping Test, HbsAg test, HCV test, HIV test, etc.

    <h3>TITLE: PCV TEST (PACKED CELL VOLUME)</h3>
    <p>
        Blood consist of few types of cells which are red blood cells. (RBC) white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets, suspended in a fluid portion called is made up of RBCs (i.e. the ratio of the volume of RBCs to the volume of WBCs) the value is expressed in percentage or fraction. The primary function of RBCs is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body.

    </h5>
    <p>
        Anti-coagulated blood in a glass capillary tube of specific length is centrifuged in a micro haematocrit centrifuge to obtain constant packing of the cell
