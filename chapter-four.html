        <h1>PARASITOLOGY</h1>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
            Parasitology is the study of parasite, their host and their relationship. As a biological discipline, the
            scope of parasitology is not determined by the organism or environment in question, but by their way of
            life. some major tests carried out in this unit include; stool microscopy, urine microscopy and malaria
            microscopy.

        <p><strong>Title: Malaria Parasites (MP) Test:</strong></p>
        <p>To detect the presence of malaria parasites in blood</p>
        <p><strong> Principles:</strong> malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease of humans and other animals
            caused by parasitic protozoan of genus plasmodium commonly the disease is transmitted by a bite from its
            salica into a persons circulatory system.</p>
            <p><strong> Material:</strong> Glass slide, syringe, oil immersion, microscope leishman stain, buffer blood. Cotton wool.</p>

    <p><strong>Procedure: </strong>A Blood sample was drop on a slide and emulsified it was then allow to dry.  It was then dip into stain (4) methylene blue basic then rsied with water dip into (B) tosin (acid) raised with water back of the slide was clear and allowed to dry.  Then view under x100 of the microscope.</p>
    <strong>Result:</strong> <p>The result is presented as scanty (+), (++), (+++), this was on how dominant malaria parasites was seen under the oil immersion (x100), the normal values ranges base on the amount of malaria parasites present  when 0 to 3 malaria parasites is present it is recorded as scanty, and from 5 to 10 malaria parasites is recorded as (+), then 10 to 15 as (++) and then 15 and above is recorded as (+++) respectively. </p>
