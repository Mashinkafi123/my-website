    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
        The student work experience scheme (SIWES) is a four (4) unit course in the department of Applied Chemistry.  The scheme affords students the opportunity of familiarizing and exposing themselves to the needed experience in handling equipment and machinery that are not usually available in the department.  It is a student skill acquisition and training program which is aimed at providing the students opportunity to apply his/her theoretical knowledge in real work situation, and also seeks to bridge the gap between theory and practical.

    <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>
        To set, Regulate training standards and provide Need-based Human capital development interventions using corps of highly competent professionals in line with global best practice

        <h2>ABOUT SIWES</h2>
        <p>
            The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES), also known as Industrial Training is a compulsory skills training program designed to expose and prepare students of Nigerian Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education, Colleges of Technology and Colleges of Agriculture, for the industrial work situation they&apos;re likely to meet after graduation. Also affords students the opportunity of familiarizing and exposing themselves to the needed experience in handling equipment and machinery that are usually not available in their institution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before the establishment of the scheme, there was a growing concern among industrialists, that graduates of institutions of higher learning lacked adequate practical background studies preparatory for employment in industries. Thus, employers were of the opinion that the theoretical education in higher institutions wasn&apos;t responsive to the needs of the employers of labour. The industrial Training Fund (I.T.F) did SIWES introduction, initiation and design in 1993 to acquaint students with the skills of handling employer&apos;s equipment and machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
            The industrial Training Fund (I.T.F) Solely funded the scheme during its formative years. However, because of financial constraints, the fund withdrew from the scheme in 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
            The federal government, noting the significance of the skills training handed the management of the scheme to both the National Universities Commission (N.U.C) and the National Board for Technical Education (N.B.T.E) in 1979. The management and implementation of the scheme was however reverted to the I.T.F by the federal government in November, 1984 and the administration was effectively taken over by the Industrial Training Fund in July 1985, with the funding solely borne by the federal government.

            INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE HOSPITAL (TEEKAY) AND THE WORKING STAFF.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I was introduced to different section of the hospital (Teekay) e.g. reception, the laboratory, pharmaceutical section, nursing section etc as well as the working staff.
        </p>
        <h3>Safety Rules and Regulations of the Hospital</h3>
        <p>
            To know laboratory hazard, Safety precaution in the hospital.
            I was thought on laboratory hazard, Safety precaution in the clinic includes the rules, regulations and measures adopted to prevent the occurrence of personal injuries, destruction of properties in the laboratory as well as the lives of the laboratory users
        </p>
